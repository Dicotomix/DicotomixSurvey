Eye-gaze Response Interface Computer Aid (ERICA) uses a camera and infrared light to detect the position of a person's gaze on a computer screen. In this way, a person can essentially type with his or her eyes, performing computer tasks normally. In addition, the software that ERICA uses can produce a computerized voice, allowing the patient to "talk" to others. In most cases, control of the eye muscles is retained throughout the span of ALS, but researchers are currently looking into devices that will allow ALS patients in advanced stages of the disease to communicate without using the eyes. In one method, an electrode is implanted directly into the brain. The electrode picks up electrical impulses and translates them into instructions for the control of a computer cursor, which in turn allows the patient to communicate via computer. Another method involves electrodes on the scalp that yield much the same result as the electrode in the brain itself. These devices take a relatively long amount of time to process information and create words (about 30 seconds per letter), but for patients whose eye movements are not under voluntary control, it is the only option. Other experimental devices translate EEG activity to translate signals into words through biofeedback.
